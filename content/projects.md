# Projects

Here is the list of open source project I've developed through the years...

## [Tango](https://github.com/bazhenov/tango)
Rust microbenchmarking harness based on [paired-testing methodology](/posts/paired-benchmarking/)


## [Groovysh Server](https://github.com/bazhenov/groovy-shell-server)  
Groovy shell embedded in an application and exposed via secure SSH channel. Helps to monitor and diagnose JVM applications using interactive REPL shell.

## [Docker TestNG Integration](https://github.com/bazhenov/docker-testng-integration)
Helps to write and run integration tests using the TestNG test framework. All configurations of the containers are provided on the annotations in the test code.

## [ttr](https://github.com/bazhenov/ttr)
Interactive task runner for Unix shell I'm using on an everyday basis.

## [Crab](https://github.com/bazhenov/crab)
Parser writing toolkit for crawling and parsing sites on the Internet. The main idea was to decouple crawling logic from the parsing logic and provide a user with a way of interactively writing a parser based on the offline mirror of the parsed site.

## [Books Highlight Export](https://github.com/bazhenov/ibooks-highlights-export)
Utility for exporting Apple Books highlights I'm using for my PKM.

## [svbyte](https://github.com/bazhenov/svbyte)
Properly vectorized Rust implementation of Stream VByte compression algorithm.

## [est](https://github.com/bazhenov/fast-estimate)
Unix shell utility to estimate the number of unique elements and heavy hitters in the stream. Very fast and using probabilistic algorithms for estimates.
