Hello 👋

My name is Denis Bazhenov. I've worked with wide variety of technologies for comercial applications as well as personal projects over last 18 years as a professional Software Developer. It's hard to list all, but here are some of them which I know quite well:

* Java language and JVM in general;
* Linux as a application platform;
* Information Retrieval Applications and [Apache Lucene](lucene) in particular. In fact I and my colleagues built *one of the largest e-commerce search systems in Russia*;
* Application performance analysis and diagnostics – it's my favorite. Each one is like detective story for me 😀;

Last 5 years I've been playing role of a technical leader in a development team helping adopt and use right technologies for job.

In my spare time I like kitesurfing 🪂, both skiing ⛷️ and snowboarding 🏂 and reading books 📚.
