# About

Hello 👋

My name is Denis. I've been a Software Developer for over 20 years, working with a wide range of technologies for commercial applications and [personal projects][projects]. It's tough to list them all, but here are a few of my favorites:

* Information retrieval applications, particularly Apache Lucene, are my area of expertise. I designed, built, and for many years assisted in operating large scale e-commerce search systems;
* Monitoring, troubleshooting, and application introspection in cloud environments;
* Rust language, application performance analysis and making software faster on modern hardware;
* Java language and JVM in general;
* Linux as an application platform.

Last 5 years I’ve been playing the role of a technical leader in a development team helping adopt and use the right technologies for the job.

In my spare time I like kitesurfing 🪂, both skiing ⛷️ and snowboarding 🏂 and reading books 📚.
