# About

Hello 👋

My name is Denis Bazhenov. I’ve worked with a wide variety of technologies for commercial applications as well as [personal projects][projects] over the last 18 years as a professional Software Developer. It’s hard to list all, but here are some of them which I know quite well:

* Information Retrieval Applications and Apache Lucene in particular. I designed and helped to build one of the largest e-commerce search systems in Russia;
* Rust language;
* Java language and JVM in general;
* Linux as an application platform;
* Mechanical Sympathy, application performance analysis and diagnostics – making software faster on modern hardware. Those are my favorite. Each one is like a detective story for me 😀;

Last 5 years I’ve been playing the role of a technical leader in a development team helping adopt and use the right technologies for the job.

In my spare time I like kitesurfing 🪂, both skiing ⛷️ and snowboarding 🏂 and reading books 📚.
